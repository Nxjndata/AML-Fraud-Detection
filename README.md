Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Fraud Detection

Project Summary

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions to strengthen Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems. Using supervised machine learning, it aims to minimize false positives (flagging legitimate transactions) and false negatives (missing actual laundering), both of which can cost financial institutions millions in losses, compliance fines, and customer trust.

Technical Approach

We implemented and compared classification models ‚Äî Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost ‚Äî trained on labeled transaction data. The models were evaluated with Stratified K-Fold cross-validation to balance bias and variance, and tuned using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

The final model was selected based on Recall (True Positive Rate) ‚Äî a priority in AML since undetected fraudulent transactions are more costly than occasional false alarms.

Business Impact

Improved Detection Accuracy: By prioritizing recall, the solution identifies more illicit transactions, reducing regulatory risks.
Minimized Compliance Costs: Better model precision reduces false positives, cutting down on manual review time and operational costs.
Enhanced Trust & Transparency: A robust AML system signals compliance maturity to regulators and builds customer trust.
Reduced Financial Losses: Early fraud detection prevents misuse of funds and protects institutional assets.
